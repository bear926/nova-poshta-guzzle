# Nova Poshta API

A PHP implementation of the Nova Poshta API via Guzzle.

This project currently implements the Cities & Warehouses List.

## Usage

You will need an API Key and CID to run the examples.
You can get them from Nova Poshta user cabinet https://my.novaposhta.ua/settings/index#apikeys. Note: you should be registered to do so.

## Requirements

 * PHP 5.4
 * php5-curl (suggested, unless you want to use a custom adapter)

## Credits

[Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org) does most of the heavy lifting. This project is really just an elaborate Guzzle Services config.
